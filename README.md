# Schur-Algorithm-Displacement-2-4

## Executive Summary
This project implements and validates the Schur algorithm for computing the Cholesky factor of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices and Toeplitz matrices with displacement ranks 2 and 4. The algorithms explore the relationship between matrix structure and algorithmic performance, focusing on numerical accuracy and computational stability. Key tasks include generating test matrices, validating the Cholesky factors, and analyzing the performance on both structured and general SPD matrices.
